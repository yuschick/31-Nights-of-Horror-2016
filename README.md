## Movie Selection Process
- Only one duplicate was allowed from the 2015 calendar
- The goal was to select a diverse range of eras, genres, and premises
- Slight preference was given to movies available online
- Slight preference was given to movies in English
- Moderate preference was given to those available at no additional expense
- I had to watch every movie before it could be on the list
