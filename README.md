It's no secret that I have an incredible love for horror movies. The **31 Nights of Horror** series began in 2015 as a way to work on a fun design and coding project while creating a resource for others who are unsure where to turn for good holiday horror.

### 2016 Summary - [View Online](http://www.danyuschick.com/31-nights-of-horror/)
Need recommendations for movies this October? Here is a calendar built in Ember showcasing many movies that may have flown under the radar. The calendar includes movie trailers, links to IMDB and where to watch the movie online; most for free!
